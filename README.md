# WHAT IS THIS???

this is a collection of custom fighter AI for Project+ developed by fudgepop01

these AI are designed with advanced techniques in-mind, and have a common system of handling
combos, pathfinding, etc. If you take a look at Captain > FitCaptain you'll see a number of
files that are all parts of the AI

The only files that are special in this directory are "Include" - which are """header"""
files that tell the AIScriptPad compiler how to operate, and this README.md file, which
you're currently reading.

To install and use these mods, follow this guide found at the following link:
