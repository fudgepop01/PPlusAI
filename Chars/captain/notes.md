Mel's Captain Falcon Coaching Notes:

Walling:
- nAir
  - stay idle to create a wall (harder for target to get in)
- fadeback nAir
  - dash forward, nair, and fade back from the very beginning to take space

When the opponent approaches:
- bAir
- nAir

Dashback fade-in dAir
- covers many grounded approach options

bait out shield-grabs ==> short hop Knee

If wall becomes compromised:
- mix in platform movement
- hold ground if possible

Try to stay close to the opponent to add pressure. Don't be afraid - if they retaliate, use fAir/bAir/etc to stuff an approach or retreat

## Why this stuff matters:

Walling:
- creates and saves some space. Might not always be perfect, but it's better than being completely idle
- once they play your game, you can start getting aggressive
